Instructional repository

Hi There!

Alex here. I like to learn to programming languages and will be using this repository to mainly create Python projects.
Python was not actually named after the animal, but rather the comedian Monty Python, who was much admired by Python's creator, Guido van Rossum.

I happen to be an admirer of Rossum, that is, Emmy Rossum.
